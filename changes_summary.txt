Summary of Changes Made to Documentation
========================================

FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Created proper 3D printing section organization:
   - Created new 3d_printing/index.rst file to organize the 3D printing section
   - Updated main index.rst to reference 3d_printing/index instead of individual files
   - This fixes the sidebar organization so 3D printing files are properly grouped in a folder

2. Updated scope and messaging to reflect comprehensive course coverage:
   - Updated index.rst to broaden scope beyond just Arduino programming
   - Updated author_note.rst to include 3D printing, circuit design, and fabrication
   - Changed references from "coding knowledge" to "technical knowledge"
   - Updated learning objectives to include all course technical aspects
   - Added "fabrication" alongside programming in skill descriptions

3. Added missing "Responsible 3D Printing" to toctree in index.rst
   - Added the page to the table of contents so it appears in the sidebar navigation

4. Fixed formatting inconsistencies in responsible_3d_printing.rst:
   - Changed title underline from asterisks (*) to equals signs (=) for consistency with other pages
   - Standardized section heading underlines throughout the document
   - Removed bold formatting from section headings (e.g., "**Before You Start**" â†’ "Before You Start")
   - Fixed spacing and indentation issues in bullet lists
   - Standardized warning and note block formatting
   - Added proper cross-reference link to iterating_design page
   - Cleaned up excessive whitespace at end of file
   - Fixed inconsistent bullet point formatting in DFX lab rules section

5. Updated iterating_design.rst title formatting:
   - Changed title underline from asterisks (*) to equals signs (=) for consistency

6. Updated removing_cleaning_prints.rst title formatting:
   - Changed title underline from asterisks (*) to equals signs (=) for consistency

7. Deleted empty temporary files:
   - Removed removing_cleaning_prints_temp.rst (empty file)
   - Removed iterating_design_temp.rst (empty file)

ISSUES RESOLVED:
- "Responsible 3D Printing" now appears in sidebar navigation
- Bold text in toctree is now consistent with other pages
- All 3D printing pages now use consistent title formatting
- 3D printing files are now properly organized in a folder in the sidebar (like other sections)
- Documentation now accurately reflects comprehensive course scope beyond just programming
- Removed duplicate/temporary files that were causing confusion
- Fixed spacing and formatting inconsistencies throughout responsible_3d_printing.rst
- Fixed "Unknown directive type toctree" error by properly organizing the 3D printing section

TO AVOID FUTURE TEMP FILE ISSUES:
- When renaming files in VSCode, use File Explorer or the integrated terminal rather than creating new files
- If you need to backup a file before major changes, copy it to a different directory or add .bak extension
- Always clean up any temporary files before committing changes
- Use git branches for experimental changes instead of creating temp files in the main directory
