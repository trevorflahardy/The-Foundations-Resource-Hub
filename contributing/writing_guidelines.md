# Writing Guidelines

Write in a clear, concise tone aimed at beginners. Avoid slang or idioms. Use active voice and second-person language when possible. Technical terms should be defined the first time they appear.

Keep sentences short and prefer lists when introducing multiple steps. The use of generative AI is allowed for generating documentation content, but it should be reviewed and edited to ensure accuracy and clarity. The tone should be professional, informative, concise, and accessible to a wide audience. Reading through chapters should be easy, with a focus on clarify, understanding, and friendliness.

It is okay to use the first person, specifically "we" or "our", to create a more engaging and approachable tone. However, avoid using "you" to maintain a neutral perspective. Do not use "I" to maintain a consistent voice across the documentation.

Ensure you read all sections of the documentation before contributing to ensure consistency in style and tone. If you are unsure about a specific section, feel free to ask for clarification or guidance.
