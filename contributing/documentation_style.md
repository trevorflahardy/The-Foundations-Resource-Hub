# Documentation Style

The official guide is written with **reStructuredText** and built using Sphinx. Use the conventions outlined on the [RST Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) page, but this is summarized below for convenience.

All documentation files should use the `.rst` extension and follow these conventions:

- `#` with overline, for parts
- `*` with overline, for chapters. Generally, used at the top of each file for main document header, as each file is commonly a chapter.
- `=` for sections within a chapter.
- `-` for subsections.
- `^` for subsubsections.
- `"` for paragraphs.

To review writing style, refer to [Writing Guidelines](writing_guidelines.md).

To build the documentation locally, see [Building the Documentation](building_docs.md).
