# Development Environment

Install Python 3.10 and Node.js. Install dependencies with:

```bash
python -m pip install -U pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install `pyright` globally for type checking:

```bash
npm install -g pyright
```

If you use Visual Studio Code, the repository includes a [dev container](dev_container.md) for a ready-to-use setup.
