HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor Control Example
=========================================

This example walks through how to control an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
using an Arduino board. Your project kit has an HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
Ultrasonic sensors are used to measure distance. They work by sending out
ultrasonic sound waves and measuring the time it takes for the sound waves
to bounce back. In this example, we will learn how to control an HC-SR04
Ultrasonic Sensor using an Arduino board.
