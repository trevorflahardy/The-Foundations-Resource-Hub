1.  Which 3D printing technology extrudes melted filament through a nozzle?
*a)  FDM
... Correct. FDM printers melt and extrude filament layer by layer.
b)  SLA
c)  SLS

2.  For a part with many small overhangs and no need for support material, which printer type is most suitable?
a)  FDM
b)  SLA
*c)  SLS
... SLS fuses powder and doesn't require supports, making it ideal for complex geometries.

3.  You need a dental model with a very smooth surface finish. Which technology should you choose and why?
a)  FDM
*b)  SLA
... SLA's laser-cured resin yields high-resolution prints with smooth surfaces, perfect for detailed dental models.
c)  SLS

4.  What is a key advantage of additive manufacturing over subtractive methods?
*a)  Reduced material waste
... Additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer, minimizing scrap.
b)  Faster machining speeds
c)  Easier material removal

5.  Which component ensures precise positioning of the printer's axes?
a)  Hotend
*b)  Stepper motors
... Stepper motors move the axes and extruder with precision.
c)  Cooling fans

6.  During the basic operation cycle, which step converts a 3D model into G-code?
a)  Printing
*b)  Slicing
... Slicing translates the model into layer-by-layer instructions.
c)  Post-processing

7.  Why are FDM printers a good fit for educational environments like USF?
a)  They require hazardous materials
*b)  They are reliable, affordable, and easy to use
... These traits make FDM printers accessible for students while teaching core concepts.
c)  They produce the highest-resolution prints
