Quiz title: Design For Printing
Quiz description: This quiz focuses on design for printing, covering various aspects of CAD modeling and 3D printing, including file formats, geometry, material metadata, and print settings. The 21-question quiz will test your knowledge of how to prepare models for successful FDM printing, from choosing the right file format to optimizing overhangs and bridge designs.
shuffle answers: true
show correct answers: true

1.  Which file format supports color and texture information?
a)  STL
*b)  OBJ
... OBJ files can include color and texture data.
c)  STEP

2.  You want to share a complex assembly with another CAD program while keeping precise geometry. Which format should you use?
a)  STL
*b)  STEP
... STEP preserves detailed geometry and assembly information for CAD tools.
c)  OBJ

3.  If your model needs to include material and manufacturing metadata, which file type is best?
a)  STL
b)  OBJ
*c)  3MF
... 3MF stores color, material, and other data useful for 3D printing.

4.  Why are overhangs below roughly 45° a problem for FDM printing?
*a)  The filament can droop without support
... Low-angle overhangs lack underlying material, causing sagging.
b)  They always require more infill
c)  Printers cannot move at that angle

5.  If you must print a 20° overhang and want to improve the result without supports, what setting might you adjust?
a)  Increase layer height
*b)  Decrease layer height
... Thinner layers reduce sag on shallow angles.
c)  Remove infill

6.  You need a press fit between a 10 mm peg and hole. What clearance should you design for?
*a)  0.1 mm
... A 0.1 mm clearance gives a snug press fit.
b)  0.2 mm
c)  0.3 mm

7.  A bridge in your model spans 25 mm of open air. What is the best design adjustment?
a)  Leave it as-is; bridges work at any length
*b)  Add supports or redesign to shorten the span
... Bridges are most reliable at ~20 mm or less; longer spans need support or redesign.
c)  Increase wall count only
