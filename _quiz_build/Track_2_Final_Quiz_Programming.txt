... The setup() function executes a single time at startup for initialization.
b)  loop()
c)  start()

4.  Which function contains code that repeats forever?
a)  setup()
*b)  loop()
... Code inside loop() runs continuously after setup() finishes.
c)  repeat()

*a)  ;
... A semicolon terminates statements in the Arduino language.
b)  :
c)  ,

6.  How do you write a single-line comment?
*a)  // comment
... Two forward slashes mark the start of a single-line comment.
b)  <!-- comment -->
c)  /* comment */

7.  Which data type stores whole numbers like 42?

... The int type holds integer values.
b)  float
c)  char

8.  Which data type holds true or false values?
a)  int
b)  float
*c)  bool
... Boolean variables store either true or false.

9.  Why would you use an array in your sketch?
*a)  To store a collection of related values under one name
... Arrays keep grouped data organized and accessible.
b)  To run code repeatedly
c)  To comment multiple lines at once

10.  What index accesses the first element of an array?
*a)  0
... Arduino arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element uses index 0.
b)  1
c)  2

11.  How do you reference the third element of `values`?
*a)  values[2];
... Index 2 retrieves the third element because arrays start counting at 0.
b)  values(3);
c)  values<2>;

12.  Which keyword sends a value back from a function?
*a)  return
... The return keyword passes data back to the caller.
b)  send
c)  break

13.  Which operator yields the remainder of a division?
a)  /
*b)  %
... The modulus operator % returns the remainder.
c)  *

14.  Which control structure is ideal for checking many discrete cases of a variable?
*a)  switch
... A switch statement branches based on specific constant values.
b)  if
c)  while

15.  Which loop is best for repeating an action a set number of times?
*a)  for loop
... A for loop combines initialization, condition, and update for fixed iterations.
b)  while loop
c)  if-else chain

16.  Which loop always executes its body at least once?
a)  while loop
*b)  do...while loop
... A do...while loop evaluates its condition after the first iteration.
c)  for loop

17.  Which function initializes serial communication at 9600 bps?
*a)  Serial.begin(9600);
... Serial.begin sets up the serial port speed.
b)  Serial.print(9600);
c)  Serial.open(9600);

18.  On the Arduino Uno, which pin is connected to the onboard LED used in the second program?
a)  7
*b)  13
... Pin 13 controls the built-in LED on the Uno.
c)  A0

19.  Which directive adds an external library to your sketch?
*a)  #include <Servo.h>
... The #include directive pulls in library code for use in your program.
b)  import Servo;
c)  using Servo;

20.  According to the code disclaimer, why might a snippet fail if pasted directly into the IDE?
*a)  It may omit setup(), loop(), or other required parts
... Many examples focus on concepts and leave out surrounding boilerplate code.
b)  The IDE blocks copied code
c)  Arduino boards cannot run pasted code

21.  Which toolbar button verifies code without uploading it?
*a)  The checkmark/Verify button
... Verify compiles your sketch to check for errors without uploading.
b)  The Upload arrow
c)  The serial monitor icon
