Quiz title: Control Structures
Quiz description: This quiz focuses on control structures in programming, specifically in Arduino, and tests understanding of logical operators, decision-making statements, and code execution. The nine-question quiz assesses knowledge of key concepts such as logical AND, decision-making keywords, and code behavior. It is designed to evaluate a programmer's grasp of fundamental control structure principles.
shuffle answers: true
show correct answers: true

1.  Which operator represents logical AND in Arduino?
... This operator ensures both expressions are true.
a)  ||

... `&&` returns true only if both sides are true.
c)  !

2.  Which keyword begins a decision-making statement?
*a)  if
... `if` checks a condition before running code.
b)  loop
c)  goto

3.  What will this code print when `x` is 3?
*a)  yes
