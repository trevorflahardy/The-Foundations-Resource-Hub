shuffle answers: true
show correct answers: true

1.  Which file format is most commonly exported from Tinkercad for 3D printing?
*a)  STL
... STL files are widely supported by slicers and are the standard for FDM printing.
b)  DOCX
c)  PSD

2.  To avoid sagging overhangs without supports, what design guideline should you follow?
*a)  Keep overhang angles at or above 45 degrees
... Angles steeper than 45° usually require supports to print successfully.
b)  Use a 90-degree overhang on every edge
c)  Increase layer height to 0.5 mm

3.  You need two parts to slide together easily but stay aligned. Which fit and clearance should you design for?
a)  Press fit with 0.1 mm clearance
*b)  Slip fit with 0.2 mm clearance
... A slip fit allows easy assembly and disassembly while maintaining alignment.
c)  Loose clearance fit with 0.5 mm clearance

4.  When naming your G-code file for submission at USF, which example follows the required format?
a)  Project1.gcode
*b)  Garcia_M_SEC2_Brace.gcode
... The required format is LastName_FirstInitial_ProfessorSection_Model.gcode.
c)  gear.gcode

5.  Why should you preview the sliced model before exporting the G-code?
a)  It automatically starts the print
*b)  To catch missing supports or adhesion issues ahead of time
... Previewing helps identify problems before you waste time and filament on a failed print.
c)  It changes the filament color

6.  After a print completes, what is the first step before removing the part from the bed?
*a)  Allow the bed to cool to room temperature
... Cooling lets the plastic harden and release naturally, protecting both the print and the build plate.
b)  Flex the plate immediately while it's hot
c)  Turn off the printer and walk away

7.  While printing, the corners of your part are lifting off the bed. What is the recommended first adjustment?
*a)  Add a one-layer brim in the slicer
... A brim increases surface area on the bed, improving adhesion and reducing warping.
b)  Switch to a metal filament
c)  Increase print speed by 50%

8.  Thin plastic hairs appear between features of your print. What change often helps reduce this stringing?
*a)  Lower the nozzle temperature by 5–10 °C
... High nozzle temperatures can cause filament to ooze and form strings between travel moves.
b)  Disable cooling fans entirely
c)  Double the infill percentage

9.  During normal operations, when is the DFX lab generally open?
*a)  Monday through Friday, 8 am–5 pm
... These are the standard hours when the University is open.
b)  24/7 access, including holidays
c)  Weekends only, 9 am–3 pm

10.  Why should you keep your USB drive with you while the printer is running?
*a)  You may need it to restart or adjust the print without re-slicing
... Having the drive nearby allows quick intervention if something goes wrong.
b)  The printer will erase the drive when finished
c)  To keep it warm for the next print

11.  The slicer automatically created a second build plate when you imported multiple models. What does this indicate?
*a)  The parts do not fit on one plate with their current orientation
... Multiple plates are generated when models exceed the build area together.
b)  The slicer detected a filament jam
c)  Your computer is low on memory

12.  A design requires a bridge spanning 30 mm. What modification would most improve print success?
*a)  Redesign to shorten the span or add supports
... Bridges longer than about 20 mm are unreliable without redesign or support.
b)  Increase layer height to 0.3 mm
c)  Disable retraction settings entirely

13.  In an FDM printer, which component pushes filament toward the hotend?
*a)  Extruder
... The extruder feeds filament into the hotend where it is melted.
b)  Heated bed
c)  Cooling fan

14.  Compared to subtractive methods, what is a primary advantage of additive manufacturing?
*a)  It creates complex parts with minimal material waste
... Additive processes build objects layer by layer, using only the material needed.
b)  It requires cutting away more material
c)  It limits design flexibility

15.  Why should you choose the bottom face of your model early in the design process?
*a)  To minimize bad overhangs and ensure good bed adhesion
... Knowing the orientation from the start helps you avoid troublesome overhangs.
b)  To make the slicer run faster
c)  To reduce the STL file size

16.  Your model must be exactly 5.5 mm tall, but you plan to slice at 0.2 mm layer height. How can you improve Z‑accuracy?
*a)  Adjust the layer height so the model height divides evenly
... Matching layer height to model height avoids rounding errors during slicing.
b)  Increase infill to 50%
c)  Switch to tree supports

17.  At USF, what infill density is recommended for most functional prints?
*a)  15%
... This density balances strength and material use for typical parts.
b)  5%
c)  50%

18.  Which Orca Flashforge tools automatically rotate and position parts for optimal printing?
*a)  Auto Orient and Arrange All Objects
... These features analyze models to find the best orientation and layout on the build plate.
b)  Tree Supports and Gyroid
c)  Preheat Bed and Extruder

19.  Before starting a print, which step belongs on your pre‑flight checklist?
*a)  Verify the build plate is clean and properly installed
... A clean, secure plate promotes good adhesion and prevents failures.
b)  Disable the cooling fan
c)  Remove the USB drive

20.  What tool should you use first to remove large support structures after printing?
*a)  Flush‑cutters
... Snipping big supports with flush‑cutters makes the remaining cleanup easier.
b)  Hammer
c)  Screwdriver
