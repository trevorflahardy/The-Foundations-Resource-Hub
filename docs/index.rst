The Foundations Resource Hub
============================

Welcome to The Foundations Resource Hub! This resource is designed to introduce you to all the technical aspects of the ``EGN 3000L`` course. All content is custom tailored to the course and includes helpful information for the programming, circuitry, and 3D printing you'll be doing. We provide a comprehensive foundation for engineering lab workâ€”from coding Arduino-based projects to fabricating parts with 3D printers. Whether you're aiming to complete assignments for this course, build an impressive engineering skill-set, or troubleshoot problems, this hub will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed.

Content is organized into dedicated sections for microcontroller programming, 3D printing, and course assignments so you can dive into each topic at your own pace.

Sections will include explanations, examples, and hands-on mini-projects you can do to reinforce your learning. Additionally, there are some "advanced sections" throughout the hub. **These advanced sections are marked as optional**, allowing you to focus on the core concepts first and explore more complex topics later, if you choose.

.. note::

   If you are an experienced programmer or maker, it is recommended to read the advanced sections, as they will provide you with additional context you may need to understand the Arduino programming language, circuit design, and other technical aspects of the course.

By working through this resource hub, you will:

- Understand what a programming language is, why it's important, and how it relates to the microcontroller work you'll do in the Engineering Lab course.
- Understand the fundamental structure and syntax of the Arduino programming language.
- Build and analyze basic circuits while applying electronics fundamentals.
- Be able to write, debug, and improve Arduino programs for a variety of applications.
- Know how to safely and effectively use 3D printers to create physical prototypes and project components.
- Gain confidence in integrating programming, circuit design, and fabrication to solve problems and create innovative solutions.

Approach this hub with an open mind and a willingness to learn, and you'll be well-prepared to tackle both the challenges and opportunities that engineering lab work presents.
