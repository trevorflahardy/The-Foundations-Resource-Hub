The Arduino Guide
=================

Welcome to The Arduino Guide! This book is designed to introduce you to all the technical aspects of the ``EGN 3000L`` course. All content is custom tailored to the course and includes helpful information for the programming, circuitry, and 3D printing you'll be doing. We provide a comprehensive foundation for working with Arduino-based projects and how you'll combine them with 3d printing to build exceptional things. Whether you're aiming to complete assignments for this course, build an impressive engineering skill-set, or just troubleshooting problems, this book will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed.

Sections will include explanations, examples, and hands-on mini-projects you can do to reinforce your learning. Additionally, there are some "advanced sections" throughout the book. **These advanced sections are marked as optional**, allowing you to focus on the core concepts first and explore more complex topics later, if you choose.

.. note::

   If you are an experienced programmer or maker, it is recommended to read the advanced sections, as they will provide you with additional context you may need to understand the Arduino programming language and other technical aspects of the course.

By the end of this book, you will:

- Understand what a programming language is, why it's important, and how it relates to Arduino and what you'll be doing in the Engineering Lab course.
- Understand the fundamental structure and syntax of the Arduino programming language.
- Be able to write, debug, and improve Arduino programs for a variety of applications.
- Know how to safely and effectively use 3D printers to create physical prototypes and project components.
- Gain confidence in using programming and fabrication to solve problems and create innovative solutions.

Approach this guide with an open mind and a willingness to learn, and you'll be well-prepared to tackle both the challenges and opportunities that engineering lab work presents.
