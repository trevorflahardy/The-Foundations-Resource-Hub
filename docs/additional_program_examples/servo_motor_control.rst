Servo Motor Control Example
===========================

This example walks through how to control a Servo motor using an Arduino
board. Your project kit has a Servo. Servo motors are small devices that
have a shaft that can be positioned to specific angular positions.
Servos are used in many applications, including robotics,
remote control cars, and airplanes. In this example, we will learn how to
control a Servo using an Arduino board.
