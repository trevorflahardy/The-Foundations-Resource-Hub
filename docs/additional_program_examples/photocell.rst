Photocell
=========

This example details how to use a photocell with an Arduino board. Photocells are light-sensitive resistors that change resistance based on the amount of light they are exposed to. In this example, we will learn how to use a photocell with an Arduino board by turning on an LED when  the light level is below a certain threshold.
