### What is a key advantage of additive manufacturing over subtractive methods?
1. [x] Reduced material waste
   > Additive manufacturing builds objects layer by layer, minimizing scrap.
1. [ ] Faster machining speeds
1. [ ] Easier material removal

### Which component ensures precise positioning of the printer's axes?
1. [ ] Hotend
1. [x] Stepper motors
   > Stepper motors move the axes and extruder with precision.
1. [ ] Cooling fans

### During the basic operation cycle, which step converts a 3D model into G-code?
1. [ ] Printing
1. [x] Slicing
   > Slicing translates the model into layer-by-layer instructions.
1. [ ] Post-processing

### Why are FDM printers a good fit for educational environments like USF?
1. [ ] They require hazardous materials
1. [x] They are reliable, affordable, and easy to use
   > These traits make FDM printers accessible for students while teaching core concepts.
1. [ ] They produce the highest-resolution prints
