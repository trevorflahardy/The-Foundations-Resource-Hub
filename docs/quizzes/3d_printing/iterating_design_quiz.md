### Which step starts the iteration cycle for improving a 3D print?
1. [x] Design
   > You begin by modeling or adjusting your design.
1. [ ] Evaluate
1. [ ] Repeat

### What information should you record in a troubleshooting log for failed prints?
1. [ ] Only the filament color
1. [x] Iteration number, changes made, and results
   > Detailed logs help track what works and what doesn't.
1. [ ] Nothing; logs aren't useful

### After addressing warping, your next print still fails the same way. What should you do?
1. [ ] Keep reprinting without changes
1. [x] Re-analyze the problem and adjust design or settings again
   > Each failure is dataâ€”use it to refine your approach.
1. [ ] Give up on the design

### Even after lowering print speed, layer shifts persist. What else might you check?
1. [x] Ensure the printer rack wheels are locked to prevent movement
   > A moving printer can cause layers to misalign.
1. [ ] Increase nozzle temperature
1. [ ] Remove all supports
