### Which file format is most commonly exported from Tinkercad for 3D printing?
1. [x] STL
   > STL files are widely supported by slicers and are the standard for FDM printing.
1. [ ] DOCX
1. [ ] PSD

### To avoid sagging overhangs without supports, what design guideline should you follow?
1. [x] Keep overhang angles at or above 45 degrees
   > Angles steeper than 45° usually require supports to print successfully.
1. [ ] Use a 90-degree overhang on every edge
1. [ ] Increase layer height to 0.5 mm

### You need two parts to slide together easily but stay aligned. Which fit and clearance should you design for?
1. [ ] Press fit with 0.1 mm clearance
1. [x] Slip fit with 0.2 mm clearance
   > A slip fit allows easy assembly and disassembly while maintaining alignment.
1. [ ] Loose clearance fit with 0.5 mm clearance

### When naming your G-code file for submission at USF, which example follows the required format?
1. [ ] Project1.gcode
1. [x] Garcia_M_SEC2_Brace.gcode
   > The required format is LastName_FirstInitial_ProfessorSection_Model.gcode.
1. [ ] gear.gcode

### Why should you preview the sliced model before exporting the G-code?
1. [ ] It automatically starts the print
1. [x] To catch missing supports or adhesion issues ahead of time
   > Previewing helps identify problems before you waste time and filament on a failed print.
1. [ ] It changes the filament color

### After a print completes, what is the first step before removing the part from the bed?
1. [x] Allow the bed to cool to room temperature
   > Cooling lets the plastic harden and release naturally, protecting both the print and the build plate.
1. [ ] Flex the plate immediately while it's hot
1. [ ] Turn off the printer and walk away

### While printing, the corners of your part are lifting off the bed. What is the recommended first adjustment?
1. [x] Add a one-layer brim in the slicer
   > A brim increases surface area on the bed, improving adhesion and reducing warping.
1. [ ] Switch to a metal filament
1. [ ] Increase print speed by 50%

### Thin plastic hairs appear between features of your print. What change often helps reduce this stringing?
1. [x] Lower the nozzle temperature by 5–10 °C
   > High nozzle temperatures can cause filament to ooze and form strings between travel moves.
1. [ ] Disable cooling fans entirely
1. [ ] Double the infill percentage

### During normal operations, when is the DFX lab generally open?
1. [x] Monday through Friday, 8 am–5 pm
   > These are the standard hours when the University is open.
1. [ ] 24/7 access, including holidays
1. [ ] Weekends only, 9 am–3 pm

### Why should you keep your USB drive with you while the printer is running?
1. [x] You may need it to restart or adjust the print without re-slicing
   > Having the drive nearby allows quick intervention if something goes wrong.
1. [ ] The printer will erase the drive when finished
1. [ ] To keep it warm for the next print

### The slicer automatically created a second build plate when you imported multiple models. What does this indicate?
1. [x] The parts do not fit on one plate with their current orientation
   > Multiple plates are generated when models exceed the build area together.
1. [ ] The slicer detected a filament jam
1. [ ] Your computer is low on memory

### A design requires a bridge spanning 30 mm. What modification would most improve print success?
1. [x] Redesign to shorten the span or add supports
   > Bridges longer than about 20 mm are unreliable without redesign or support.
1. [ ] Increase layer height to 0.3 mm
1. [ ] Disable retraction settings entirely

### In an FDM printer, which component pushes filament toward the hotend?
1. [x] Extruder
   > The extruder feeds filament into the hotend where it is melted.
1. [ ] Heated bed
1. [ ] Cooling fan

### Compared to subtractive methods, what is a primary advantage of additive manufacturing?
1. [x] It creates complex parts with minimal material waste
   > Additive processes build objects layer by layer, using only the material needed.
1. [ ] It requires cutting away more material
1. [ ] It limits design flexibility

### Why should you choose the bottom face of your model early in the design process?
1. [x] To minimize bad overhangs and ensure good bed adhesion
   > Knowing the orientation from the start helps you avoid troublesome overhangs.
1. [ ] To make the slicer run faster
1. [ ] To reduce the STL file size

### Your model must be exactly 5.5 mm tall, but you plan to slice at 0.2 mm layer height. How can you improve Z‑accuracy?
1. [x] Adjust the layer height so the model height divides evenly
   > Matching layer height to model height avoids rounding errors during slicing.
1. [ ] Increase infill to 50%
1. [ ] Switch to tree supports

### At USF, what infill density is recommended for most functional prints?
1. [x] 15%
   > This density balances strength and material use for typical parts.
1. [ ] 5%
1. [ ] 50%

### Which Orca Flashforge tools automatically rotate and position parts for optimal printing?
1. [x] Auto Orient and Arrange All Objects
   > These features analyze models to find the best orientation and layout on the build plate.
1. [ ] Tree Supports and Gyroid
1. [ ] Preheat Bed and Extruder

### Before starting a print, which step belongs on your pre‑flight checklist?
1. [x] Verify the build plate is clean and properly installed
   > A clean, secure plate promotes good adhesion and prevents failures.
1. [ ] Disable the cooling fan
1. [ ] Remove the USB drive

### What tool should you use first to remove large support structures after printing?
1. [x] Flush‑cutters
   > Snipping big supports with flush‑cutters makes the remaining cleanup easier.
1. [ ] Hammer
1. [ ] Screwdriver
