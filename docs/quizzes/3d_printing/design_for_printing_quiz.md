### Why are overhangs below roughly 45° a problem for FDM printing?
1. [x] The filament can droop without support
   > Low-angle overhangs lack underlying material, causing sagging.
1. [ ] They always require more infill
1. [ ] Printers cannot move at that angle

### If you must print a 20° overhang and want to improve the result without supports, what setting might you adjust?
1. [ ] Increase layer height
1. [x] Decrease layer height
   > Thinner layers reduce sag on shallow angles.
1. [ ] Remove infill

### You need a press fit between a 10 mm peg and hole. What clearance should you design for?
1. [x] 0.1 mm
   > A 0.1 mm clearance gives a snug press fit.
1. [ ] 0.2 mm
1. [ ] 0.3 mm

### A bridge in your model spans 25 mm of open air. What is the best design adjustment?
1. [ ] Leave it as-is; bridges work at any length
1. [x] Add supports or redesign to shorten the span
   > Bridges are most reliable at ~20 mm or less; longer spans need support or redesign.
1. [ ] Increase wall count only
