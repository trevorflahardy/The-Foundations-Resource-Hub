### Which infill pattern is commonly used at USF for a balance of strength and speed?
1. [ ] Gyroid
1. [x] Grid
   > Grid infill offers a good mix of strength and efficiency for most prints.
1. [ ] Rectilinear

### Tree supports are especially useful when?
1. [ ] Your model has a large flat overhang
1. [x] Your model has complex geometry with small, non-planar overhangs
   > Tree supports use branched structures that support intricate shapes efficiently.
1. [ ] You want the smoothest surface on a large flat bottom

### If your model features a wide, flat overhang and surface quality is critical, which support type should you choose?
1. [x] Normal supports
   > Normal supports provide better surface finish for broad planar overhangs.
1. [ ] Tree supports
1. [ ] No supports
