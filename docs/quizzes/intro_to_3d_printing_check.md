### Which 3D printing technology extrudes melted filament through a nozzle?
1. [x] FDM
   > Correct. FDM printers melt and extrude filament layer by layer.
1. [ ] SLA
1. [ ] SLS

### For a part with many small overhangs and no need for support material, which printer type is most suitable?
1. [ ] FDM
1. [ ] SLA
1. [x] SLS
   > SLS fuses powder and doesn't require supports, making it ideal for complex geometries.

### You need a dental model with a very smooth surface finish. Which technology should you choose and why?
1. [ ] FDM
1. [x] SLA
   > SLA's laser-cured resin yields high-resolution prints with smooth surfaces, perfect for detailed dental models.
1. [ ] SLS
