Programming with Microcontrollers
=================================

This section covers the programming concepts used throughout EGN 3000L.  It begins with an overview of the Arduino environment and then walks through language basics, control flow, and working with libraries.  Each page builds on the previous so you can gradually develop your skills before applying them in the lab.
