IR Sensor Example
=================

This example walks through how to control an IR Sensor using an Arduino board. Your project kit has an IR Sensor. IR Sensors are used to detect the presence of an object. They work by emitting an infrared light and measuring the amount of light that is reflected back. In this example, we will learn how to control an IR Sensor using an Arduino board.
