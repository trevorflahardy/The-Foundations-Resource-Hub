H-Bridge Control Example
========================

This example walks through how to control an H-Bridge using an Arduino board.  Your project kit has an H-Bridge and two yellow DC motors. H-Bridges are used to control the speed and direction of a motor. They work by controlling the direction of the current flow through the motor. In this example, we will learn how to control an H-Bridge using an Arduino board.
