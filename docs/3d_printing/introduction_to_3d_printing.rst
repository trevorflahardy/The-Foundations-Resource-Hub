Welcome to the world of 3D printing! In this section, we'll explore the fundamentals of 3D printing, its various types, and the anatomy of a typical 3D printer. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for your hands-on experiences in the lab.

What is 3D Printing?
====================

Understanding 3D Printing
--------------------------

:term:`3D printing<3D Printing>`, also known as :term:`additive manufacturing<Additive Manufacturing>`, is a process of creating three-dimensional objects from a digital file. This is achieved by laying down successive layers of material until the object is complete. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object.

Real-World Applications
------------------------
3D printing has revolutionized various industries:

- **Prototyping**: Engineers and designers use 3D printing to create prototypes quickly and cost-effectively, allowing for rapid iteration and development.
- **Healthcare**: Customized prosthetics, dental implants, and even bioprinted organs are being developed using 3D printing technologies.
- **Aerospace and Automotive**: Manufacturers produce lightweight, complex parts that are difficult or impossible to create with traditional methods.
- **Fashion and Footwear**: Companies like Adidas are launching fully 3D-printed shoes, showcasing the technology's potential in consumer products.

Additive vs. Subtractive Manufacturing
--------------------------------------

In :term:`additive manufacturing<Additive Manufacturing>`, objects are built by adding material layer by layer. In contrast, **subtractive manufacturing** involves removing material from a solid block to create the desired shape, such as in milling or drilling.

Additive manufacturing offers advantages like reduced material waste, the ability to create complex geometries, and faster prototyping cycles.


Types of 3D Printers
=====================

There are several types of 3D printing technologies, each with its own strengths and applications:

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)
-------------------------------

:term:`FDM<FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)>` is the most **common and accessible** form of 3D printing. It works by melting and extruding thermoplastic filament through a heated nozzle, depositing material layer by layer to build the object. FDM printers are widely used in education, hobbyist projects, and prototyping due to their affordability and ease of use.

.. tip::

  You will only be using a FDM-style 3D printer in the Foundations printing lab. The other types of 3D printers displayed below are merely for reference, comparison, and to help you understand the differences between the various types of 3D printing technologies.

Stereolithography (SLA)
-----------------------

:term:`SLA<SLA (Stereolithography)>` printers use a laser to cure liquid resin into hardened plastic in a layer-by-layer fashion. This method produces high-resolution prints with smooth surface finishes, making it ideal for detailed prototypes and models.

Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)
-------------------------------

:term:`SLS<SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)>` employs a laser to sinter powdered material, typically nylon or other polymers, fusing the particles together to form a solid structure. SLS does not require support structures, allowing for the creation of complex geometries. It's commonly used in industrial applications for functional parts

The USF 3D Printers - What We Use & Why
---------------------------------------

At the University of South Florida, we utilize **FlashForge Adventurer 5M** 3D printers. These **FDM printers** are chosen for their reliability, user-friendly interface, and suitability for educational environments. They provide a practical platform for students to learn the fundamentals of 3D printing.

Anatomy of a 3D Printer
========================

Understanding the components of a 3D printer helps in grasping how the printing process works:

Key Components
--------------

- :term:`Extruder`: Feeds the filament into the hotend.
- :term:`Hotend`: Heats and melts the filament, allowing it to be deposited onto the build platform.
- :term:`Build Platform (Heated Bed)`: The surface on which the object is printed. A heated bed helps in preventing warping and improves adhesion.
- :term:`Stepper Motors`: Control the movement of the printer's axes (X, Y, and Z) and the extruder, ensuring precise positioning.
- **Cooling Fans**: Help in solidifying the extruded filament quickly, maintaining print quality.

Basic Operation Cycle
---------------------

1. **Design**: Create a 3D model using computer-aided design (CAD) software.
2. **Slicing**: Convert the 3D model into layers and generate G-code using slicing software.
3. **Printing**: The printer reads the :term:`G-code` and deposits material layer by layer to build the object.
4. **Post-Processing**: After printing, the object may require cleaning, support removal, or other finishing processes.

By understanding these basics, you're well on your way to becoming proficient in 3D printing. In the next sections, we'll delve deeper into 3D modeling, preparing files for printing, and hands-on printing techniques.
