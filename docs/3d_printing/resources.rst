Glossary of 3D Printing Terms
=============================

.. glossary::

  3D Printing
    A process of creating three-dimensional objects by layering material based on digital models.

  Additive Manufacturing
    Another term for 3D printing, emphasizing the layer-by-layer addition of material.

  FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling)
    A 3D printing method that extrudes melted thermoplastic filament to build objects.

  SLA (Stereolithography)
    A 3D printing technique that uses a laser to cure liquid resin into solid parts.

  SLS (Selective Laser Sintering)
    A 3D printing process that uses a laser to fuse powdered material into solid structures.

  Extruder
    The component that feeds filament into the hotend of a 3D printer.

  Hotend
    The part of a 3D printer that heats and melts the filament for extrusion.

  Build Platform (Heated Bed)
    The surface on which a 3D printer builds an object, often heated to improve adhesion.

  Stepper Motors
    Motors that precisely control the movement of a 3D printer's components.

  G-code
    A language used to instruct CNC machines, including 3D printers, on how to move and operate.

  3D Model
    A digital representation of a physical object used in 3D printing.

  STL (Stereolithography)
    A file format representing 3D models as a mesh of triangles, commonly used in 3D printing.

  OBJ (Object File)
    A file format that includes 3D geometry, color, and texture information.

  STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data)
    A file format used for sharing complex 3D models between different CAD programs.

  3MF (3D Manufacturing Format)
    A modern file format that includes comprehensive data for 3D printing, such as color, material, and metadata.

  Overhang
    A part of a 3D model that extends outward without support beneath, potentially requiring additional structures during printing.

  Bridging
    The process of printing a horizontal span between two points without support beneath.

  Supports
    Temporary structures added during 3D printing to support overhangs and bridges, removed after printing.

  Tinkercad
    An online, beginner-friendly CAD tool for creating 3D models.

  Infill
    The internal structure of a 3D print, which can be solid or patterned to provide strength while minimizing material use.

  Tree Supports
    A type of support structure that branches out like a tree, providing support for complex overhangs while minimizing material use.

  Normal Supports
    Traditional support structures that are printed directly under overhangs, often leaving marks on the model.

  Orientation
    The positioning and rotation of a 3D model on the build platform, which affects print quality and support requirements.

  Brim
    A thin ring of material printed around the base of a model to improve bed adhesion.

  Raft
    A thicker base layer printed beneath a model to enhance adhesion and stability during printing.
