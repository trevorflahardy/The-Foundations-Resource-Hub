An Important Author Note
=========================

This book is designed to comprehensively cover the technical knowledge needed for the Foundations of Engineering Lab course at the University of South Florida; **It is assumed that you have no prior experience with programming, 3D printing, or circuit design**, and every concept will be explained from the ground up. From basic programming principles to 3D printing techniques and circuit fundamentals, this book will guide you step-by-step through everything you need to know to succeed in this course.

It is **highly recommended** to watch the USF Lecture named `Guide to Arduino Programming <https://usflearn.instructure.com/media_objects_iframe/m-4Yk6sdQUSQQSFNpTDzSkCCPySe5JcLJg?type=video?type=video>`_ by professor Schinnel Small before reading this book. The video will give you an overview of many of the topics covered in this book, and will show you hands on examples of how to get started with Arduino programming.

This book is **aimed at being a comprehensive reference for all course material**. It details sections not completely covered in the video, clarifies topics, and provides additional examples, explanations, and exercises to help you understand Arduino programming, 3D printing, and other technical aspects of the lab. Additionally, it can be used as an easy reference for all aspects of this course, so you do not have to go back and refer to the video or lecture slides.

These topics can be challenging, but are also some of the most rewarding skills you can develop as an aspiring engineer. As the semester progresses, you might feel overwhelmed or tempted to rely on shortcuts, like using generative AI to write your code. However, doing so compromises the learning process and violates the school's academic integrity policy. More importantly, it denies you the opportunity to gain the skills that will set you apart as a future engineer experienced in problem-solving, programming, fabrication, and creating innovative solutions.

We understand that learning to program can feel daunting at times, and we're here to help you succeed. If you're struggling, **don't hesitate to ask for support**. Utilize the resources available to youâ€”whether that's office hours, peer study groups, or tutoring services. Remember, making mistakes and asking questions are essential parts of the learning process. Embrace the challenge, and know that every step you take builds a foundation for an exciting future.

Without further ado, let's dive into the world of what foundations of engineering lab entails!
